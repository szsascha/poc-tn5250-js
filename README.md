# Proof of concept tn5250 js client

Simple proof of concept for a 5250 telnet client in javascript.
Started as a weekendproject and intended to create a lib by the learnings from this project.

This project isn't really runnable. It just receives, display and sent data to an IBM i via tn5250.

There are many known bugs and errors in this project. Furthermore many things are not really implemented.

All in all I got my learnings out of it and am now able to start working on a 5250 library in javascript / typescript.
